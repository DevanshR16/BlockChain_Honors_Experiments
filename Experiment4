/* Follow these steps before executing a smart contract in truffle environment
  Install Node.js and npm:
  Truffle and Ganache both rely on Node.js and npm. If you haven't already installed them, you can download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

  Install Truffle:
  Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Truffle globally:
  'npm install -g truffle'

  Install Ganache UI:
  You can install Ganache UI by downloading it from the official website.
  Visit the Ganache website at https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache and
  download the version that suits your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

  Run Ganache UI:
  After downloading Ganache UI, install it by following the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
  Once installed, open Ganache UI.

  Start Ganache:
  Launch Ganache UI, and you'll see options to start a new workspace or open an existing one.
  You can start a new workspace, which will create a new personal Ethereum blockchain for your development.
  Click "Start" or "Quickstart" to initiate the blockchain.

  Now run the 'truffle init' command in a desired directory where you installed truffle with npm to initialize the project.
  Edit your truffle-config.json file to connect with ganache as follows */
  module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",     // Ganache's default host
      port: 7545,            // Ganache's default port
      network_id: "*",       // Match any network ID
    },
  },
};
/* Now Execute the following smart contract by creating a file called Student.sol in the contract dir created by truffle*/

    struct Student {
        uint256 id;

    }

    uint256 public totalStudents;
    mapping(uint256 => Student) public students;

    event StudentCreated(uint256 id, string name, uint256 age);

    function createStudent(uint256 _id, string memory _name, uint256 _age) public {
        students[totalStudents] = Student(_id, _name, _age);
        totalStudents++;

        emit StudentCreated(_id, _name, _age);
    }
}



/* Compile and migrate your contracts:
In your Truffle project directory, you can compile and migrate your smart contracts to the Ganache
blockchain using the following Truffle commands:

'truffle compile'
'truffle migrate --network ganache'

Share the contract hash with Sir*/
